===============

Github Pages user page. Built with Jekyll, Grunt and Yeoman. The production repo for this site is over at [github.com/richardwestenra/richardwestenra.github.io](https://github.com/richardwestenra/richardwestenra.github.io).

This is a port (and very minor redesign) of my old site, which was built in Wordpress in 2010. For the new site, I've adapted the homepage to make it more responsive, optimised the CSS/JS, and updated the content (particularly the portfolio). I've also kept most of the old posts, made them responsive where possible.

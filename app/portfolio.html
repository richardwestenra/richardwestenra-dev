		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>This is a selection of some of my recent work, though unfortunately I&rsquo;m unable to showcase some of my favourites for confidentiality reasons. These pieces were created by our team of designers, copywriters, data-journalists and creative producers. I enjoy both design and development, but have usually been responsible for just the development for most of these pieces, due to the resource availability of our creative team.</p>
